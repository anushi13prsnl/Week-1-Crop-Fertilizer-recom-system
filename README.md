## 🗂️ What's Inside?

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Session_I_Mentoring_Session.docx` | Definitions of ML, Supervised Learning, Labelled Data, Classification & Regression |
| `crop_recom_algorithm.ipynb` | Google Colab notebook to upload and load data using pandas |
| `rop_recommendation (l).csv` | Crop recom dataset from Kaggle |

## 🧠 Quick Summary: what we did

### ✅ Baisc Theory:

- Understood **what ML is**, with simple real-life examples
- Discussed **supervised learning** using labelled data
- Learnt the difference between:
  - **Classification** → 📦 Predict categories 
  - **Regression** → 🔢 Predict numbers 

---

### ✅ Practical on google colab:

- 🔼 Uploaded dataset
- 📚 Imported necessary libraries (for data loading n processing and data visualization)
```python
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns
```
- 📥 Loaded CSV using `df = pd.read_csv()`
- 👀 Displayed first 5 records with `df.head()`
- ℹ️ Checked dataset info with `df.info()`
