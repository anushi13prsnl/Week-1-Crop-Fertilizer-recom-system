## 📚 Week 1  
**Mentoring Session 1: ML Basics & Data Loading**

### ✅ Quick Summary:

#### 🧠 Basic Theory:
- Introduced **Machine Learning** with real-world examples.
- Explained **Supervised Learning**, **Labelled Data**, and the difference between:
  - **Classification** → Predicting categories
  - **Regression** → Predicting numeric values

#### 💻 Practical:
- Used **Google Colab** to upload and load data.
- Imported libraries like:
  ```python
  import numpy as np  
  import pandas as pd  
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
  import seaborn as sns
  ```
- Loaded dataset using `pd.read_csv()`
- Explored data using `df.head()` and `df.info()`

## 📚 Week 2  
**Crop Prediction – Initial Code Drafting**

### ✅ Quick Summary:

- Created `Crop_Prediction.ipynb` notebook
- Added initial code snippets relevant to crop prediction logic.
- Served as a **Week 2 submission placeholder**.
- Work-in-progress; further model building and evaluation to follow in upcoming weeks.
